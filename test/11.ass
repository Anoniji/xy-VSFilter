Even if the song already existed, a programmed toy accepts it just fine.  Gnawing on a leek, looking up at the sky, shedding tears, noticing that even all that is fading.  Even songs depend on character.  With no reliable source for foundation, the place I came from already destroyed.  When everyone forgets me, I'll have no heart or anything left.  I can see the end of the world for a Vocaloid.
